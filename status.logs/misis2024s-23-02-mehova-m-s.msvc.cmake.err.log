CMake Warning (dev) at C:/Program Files/CMake/share/cmake-3.25/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:438 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (OpenCV)
  does not match the name of the calling package (opencv).  This can lead to
  problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  C:/Programs/vcpkg/installed/x64-windows/share/opencv/OpenCVConfig.cmake:354 (find_package_handle_standard_args)
  C:/Programs/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake:859 (_find_package)
